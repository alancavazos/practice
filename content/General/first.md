Howdy Y'all, 

This is my first time making a website and I wanted to say that this website is for a project.
 
I had spent a lot of time figuring out how to set it up. I watch ten youtube videoes and until I found the right one that is up to date and does not require a lot of other programs. I thought of using the Django at first but stuck with Pelican. The video that help me was [youtube.com/watch?v=166eHphex2k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=166eHphex2k). It was hard to listen too but the step were easy to follow and works. I suggest y'all should check it out if you are struggling. Additionally, I had to learn a new language. I have had previous projects that required me to create a website on a server in HTML but this project was totally different. 

We used [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) for the website which is a static site generator, written in Python that requires no database or server-side logic. For further information click on the link provided.
